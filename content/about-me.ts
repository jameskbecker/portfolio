const aboutMe = `I began my web development journey **five years** ago, teaching myself to code with the goal of creating automation scripts. It was during this time that I fell in love with programming, discovering the **endless possibilities** of building digital solutions. After spending about a year as a self-taught developer, I decided to pursue a degree in **Computer Science.**

By the end of my first year, I found myself working on my very first paid project, which eventually led to a job offer. However, I made the decision to continue freelancing, as it allowed me to strike a **balance** between work and my university studies, where I could truly **master my craft**.

During my final year at university, I decided to **specialise in frontend engineering**. Recently, I had the privilege of serving as a frontend engineer for an early-stage e-commerce start-up. I worked closely with a small, **cross-functional** team on a enterprise-level codebase. My key responsiblities included establishing a **scaleable** frontend, contributing my ideas to product design and staying in **close communcation** with my team.

My strengths lie in **TypeScript, React and related frameworks like NextJS**. I also have solid foundations in the more traditional HTML, CSS and JavaScript which I used before transition to TypeScript and React.`;
