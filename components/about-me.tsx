      I began my web development journey five years ago, teaching myself to code
      with the goal of creating automation scripts. It was during this time that
      I fell in love with programming, discovering the{' '}
      <strong>endless possibilities</strong> of building digital solutions.
      After spending about a year as a self-taught developer, I decided to
      pursue a degree in <strong>Computer Science.</strong>

      By the end of my first year, I found myself working on my very first paid
      project, which eventually led to a job offer. However, I made the decision
      to continue freelancing, as it allowed me to strike a{' '}
      <strong>balance</strong> between work and my university studies, where I
      could truly <strong>master my craft</strong>.

      During my final year at university, I decided to specialise in frontend
      engineering. Recently, I had the privilege of serving as a frontend
      engineer for an early-stage e-commerce start-up. I worked closely with a
      small, <strong>cross-functional</strong> team on a enterprise-level
      codebase. My key responsiblities included establishing a{' '}
      <strong>scaleable</strong> frontend, contributing my ideas to product
      design and staying in <strong>close communcation</strong> with my team.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths lie in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>{' '}
      and related frameworks like <strong>NextJS</strong>. I also have solid
      foundations in the more traditional HTML, CSS and JavaScript which I used
      before transition to TypeScript and React.
